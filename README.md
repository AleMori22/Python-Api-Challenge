# Python-Api-Challenge

Hello. 

You'll find the two script for the analysis in the folder named **Code**, as **WeatherPy.ipynb** and **VacationPy.ipynb**.

The first is going to return a dataframe with a random number of cities around the globe and relative data regarding the weather of those cities, store them in a .csv file named **cities.csv** and saves it in the output_data folder, in order to be analysed by the second script. 
Also this first script will return four different visualizations named **'City_Latitude_vs._Max_Temperature'.png**, **City_Latitude_vs._Cloudiness.png**, **City_Latitude_vs._Humidit_.png** and **City_Latitude_vs._Wind_Speed.png**. These graphs are correlating the various cities' latitudes to: Max temperature, Cloudiness, Humidity and Wind Speed respectively.
In the end, in the last part of this script, you'll find my analysis of the correlation between the factors taken in exam in the previous graphs, that is done by dividing them into two groups: northern and southern hemisphere.

The second script will take the .csv file named **cities.csv** and saves it in the **output_data** folder and return two maps. The first one showing all the cities in the file on a world map color coding them by city and with humidity value as size. The script will later select the cities with the climate factors that we are looking for in our hypothetical destination, find hotels for the remaining destinations and show them in the second map where we can find the name and country in the overlay information.

The script is being done by me with the help of the documentation and the class materials.
